    <div>
        My mother called me Blue Nile <br>
        I am also named by mother White Nile <br>
        When we grew and grew we asked <br>
        Oh mother, Oh mother <br>
        Tell us, why did you name us Nile <br>
        Our mothers said lovingly <br>
        Oh our children <br>
        You travel and travel <br>
        Cross mountains, forests and valleys <br>
        Thousands of miles, enriching nine countries <br>
        you reach Khartoum <br>
        you Blue and White Niles confluence with a mission <br>
        God has commanded you to give a message <br>
        you give a beautiful message <br>
        When we rivers confluence <br>
        Oh humanity why not your hearts confluence <br>
        And you blossom with happiness. <br><br>
